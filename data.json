    "events_text": "GNHâ€™s largest event of the year is the company expose that is held the day before the career fair. The expose is an opportunity for students to interact and meet with recruiters in a casual setting before the  career fair. This also allows the students to make a connection with them so it is easier to interact at the career fair. Students and recruiters mingle and get to know each other through games and other engaging activities. This is also a good opportunity for students to prep for the upcoming career fair ",
